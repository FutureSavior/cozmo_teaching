ring ring...ring ring...ring ring...
Yes, this is or Cozmo calling. May I speak to Mr. Franks, please?
Uhm...actually, this call is rather urgent. We spoke yesterday about a delivery problem that Mr. Franks mentioned. Did he leave any information with you?
Yes, the shipment was delayed from France. But it is on the way now. Could I schedule a meeting with Mr. Frank on Thursday afternoon?
Unfortunately, that doesnâ€™t suit me. Is he doing anything on Friday morning?
Great, should I come by at 9?
Yes, 10 would be great.
No, I think that's everything. Thank you for your help...Goodbye.
